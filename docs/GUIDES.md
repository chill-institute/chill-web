### Keep the feed private

RSS feed URLs include a token tied to your session, so keep them private.

If you revoke the token, sign out, or I break something on my side, the old URL may stop working. If that happens, sign out and sign back in to `chill.institute`, then replace the feed URL in put.io with a freshly generated one.

## Reporting a crash

1. If the crash fallback appears, add a short note about what you were doing.
2. Click `Copy report` if you want to paste the details manually.
3. Click `Create GitHub issue` if you want a prefilled bug report in the public repo.
