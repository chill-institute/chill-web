# Web

`web` is a Vite+ workspace repo that hosts the Cloudflare Pages frontends for `chill.institute` and `binge.institute`.

## Structure

- `apps/chill/` is the main `chill.institute` app with search and catalog flows
- `apps/binge/` is the `binge.institute` app with the catalog-only experience
- the repo root owns shared workspace config, scripts, hooks, and CI entrypoints

## Stack

- React SPAs with TanStack Router and TanStack Query
- Vite+ workspace tooling through `vp`
- app-local Playwright suites in each app directory

## Commands

- `vp install`
- `vp run ready`
- `vp run dev:chill`
- `vp run dev:binge`
- `vp run verify`
- `vp run verify:chill`
- `vp run verify:binge`
- `vp run e2e`
- `vp run e2e:chill`
- `vp run e2e:binge`
- `vp run knip`

## Conventions

- Keep repo entrypoints in the root [package.json](./package.json); they should call `vp` underneath.
- Prefer `vp` over direct `pnpm`, `vite`, `vitest`, or `playwright` invocations.
- Keep shared dependency versions in the workspace catalog in [pnpm-workspace.yaml](./pnpm-workspace.yaml)
- Keep browser-side API resolution app-local in `apps/*/src/lib/env.ts`
- Keep shadcn config app-local in `apps/*/components.json`
- Prefer intentional duplication between `apps/chill/` and `apps/binge/` until a real shared package boundary is worth the complexity.
- Keep Vite and hook/config changes minimal and intentional.
- Keep `.vite-hooks/` as the canonical hook path; `.githooks/` exists only as a compatibility shim for stale local Git config.
- CI fans shared workspace changes such as `packages/*`, `tools/*`, and root build config out to both apps, but it skips app deploy jobs for docs-only or workflow-only edits.
